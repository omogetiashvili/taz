        <h2>

          Tazo Skhirtladze, the youngest millionaire in Georgia, dominates social networks and has a great influence on them. Tazo graduated from Oxford University. At the age of 21, he already had 15 million dollars in his bank account. The main question is did he make millions by trading or was there room for fraud?
